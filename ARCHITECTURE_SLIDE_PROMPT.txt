Create a professional system architecture diagram for an "Agentic AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance & Quality Intelligence Platform" that fits perfectly in a 16:9 slide (1920x1080px).

LAYOUT STRUCTURE (Top to Bottom):

[CLIENT LAYER - Top]
- Web Dashboard (Next.js/React)
- Mobile App (React Native) [optional, dashed]
- IoT Devices (Vehicle Telemetry Sensors)

[API GATEWAY LAYER]
- API Gateway (FastAPI, Rate Limiting, Auth)
- Load Balancer

[CORE SERVICES LAYER - Main Section, Horizontal]
Left to Right:
1. Orchestration Service (LangGraph)
   - Master Agent
   - Worker Agents (Data Analysis, Diagnosis, Voice, Scheduling, Feedback, Manufacturing)
   - Shadow Safety Twin
2. ML Inference Service (Hybrid RF + LSTM)
3. UEBA Engine (Isolation Forest + Intent Graph)
4. Scheduling Optimizer (OR-Tools)
5. Voice AI Service (Azure TTS + Whisper + Sentiment)
6. Manufacturing Analytics (KMeans + RCA/CAPA)

[DATA LAYER - Bottom]
- TimescaleDB (Time-Series)
- PostgreSQL (Relational)
- Elasticsearch (Search/Logs)
- Azure SQL (Data Warehouse)
- Vector DB FAISS (Knowledge Base)

[INFRASTRUCTURE - Between Services & Data]
- Apache Kafka (Streaming)
- WebSocket Server

[EXTERNAL SERVICES - Right Side]
- Azure Cognitive Services
- Cloud Storage (Azure Blob)
- Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)

[SECURITY - Perimeter]
- UEBA Guard
- API Authentication (OAuth2/JWT)
- Network Security (VPC/Firewall)
- Audit Logging

DATA FLOWS (Show with arrows):
1. IoT → Kafka → TimescaleDB (Telemetry)
2. Telemetry → ML Inference → Orchestration (Risk Scoring)
3. Orchestration → Worker Agents → External Services (Actions)
4. Agents → UEBA Guard → Decision (Safety Checks)
5. Manufacturing Events → Analytics → PostgreSQL (RCA/CAPA)
6. All Services → Elasticsearch (Audit)

COLOR SCHEME:
- Blue: Data/Storage
- Green: ML/AI
- Orange: Services/APIs
- Purple: Security
- Gray: Infrastructure

STYLE:
- Clean, modern design
- Grouped components in containers
- Clear labels (10pt+ font)
- Standard cloud icons
- Professional color palette
- Adequate whitespace
- 10% margins on all sides

KEY ANNOTATIONS (Small callouts):
- "Hybrid ML: RF (pattern) + LSTM (temporal)"
- "LangGraph: Stateful orchestration"
- "Shadow Twin: Safety validation"
- "UEBA: Anomaly + Intent monitoring"

OUTPUT: High-resolution image (PNG/SVG) suitable for presentation, 16:9 aspect ratio, clear and professional.
